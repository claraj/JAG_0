# Lab 0

### Question 1 - Add Numbers

Finish the method that adds two numbers, and returns the total.
 
 
### Question 2 - Shouting Strings

Finish the shout() method. It should convert a String to uppercase, and add "!!!" to the end.

So if the user enters "hello", the method will be called with "hello". The method will turn "hello" into "HELLO!!!"

So if the user enters "Programming is fun", your program will print "PROGRAMMING IS FUN!!!"


### Question 3 - Miles to Kilometers

Finish the milesToKilometers method.
This method should use the miles variable, and convert it to the equivalent number of kilometers. It will return the number of kilometers to the main method.

Use 1.6 as the conversion factor. So, 1 mile = 1.6 kilometers.
 

### Question 4 - Triplicate String

Finish the triplicate() method. This method should create a String from three exact copies of itself.
 
So if the method is given the string "cat", it will return "catcatcat".
 
 
### Question 5 - Class Setup
 
Class setup checklist
 
This isn't really a program, but read through the checklist, complete the items, and update
the variables as you complete each task so the autograder knows you've done all the things.
